- 👋 Hi, I’m @isiksamet, your friendly neighborhood tech wizard
- 👀 I’m interested in Kubernetes and automation tools (because who doesn't love a good robot army?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud infrastructure like Kubernetes and security stuff (because the cloud isn't just for rain anymore)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving C#, .NET, Python, PowerShell, and algorithms (aka the secret sauce of coding)
- 📫 How to reach me: (Carrier pigeons accepted)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (but you can call me Samet, the Magnificent)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a systems expert with a development background, I work on SAP Basis, and have no experience with physical servers (because why touch metal when you can code?)
